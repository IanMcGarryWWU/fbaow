Just as life’s biodiversity adds to its capacity for creative evolution, so does our cultural diversity constitute a wealth of experience and perspectives. The point is not that we all need to agree on everything or see the world in the same way, rather it is that in our diversity we all aim to participate in ways that support the health, well-being and evolutionary potential of all of humanity and all of life.There is no one-size-fits-all receipt for creating regenerative cultures. Sorry to disappoint."
