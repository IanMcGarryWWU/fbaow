                        The critical watersheds of the Northern Range of Trinidad are also
                        quite vulnerable to fires. These exposed slopes rapidly dry out during
                        the early dry season and fires started in these areas easily burn out
                        of control. Over the years, repeated fires have resulted in the
                        maintenance of fire-climax grasslands on several ridges of the Northern
                        Range. These grasslands also serve as corridors for the spread of fires
                        onto adjoining forests. These fire prone grasses are therefore
                        replacing more and more forests. The end result is a series of
                        environmental disasters including siltation and flooding of low-lying
                        areas.

                <p>
                    The drought associated with the 1986-87 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
                    resulted in the St. Ann&#8217;s ridge overlooking Port of Spain loosing
                    much of its forest canopy due to fire. The area that has been reduced to a
                    fire climax ecosystem of Bull/Elephant/Corn grass, Razor grass, Bracken
                    (Fern), Cocorite and Gru gru bef (Banga) has increased almost annually
                    since then.

                    The awareness of the dire consequences of this tragedy has yet to reach
                    critical mass in the minds of the souls, resident in and visitors to the
                    watershed.

                    Flooding is a measure of surface runoff, the more impermeable surface area
                    there is the more runoff there will be. In a healthy tropical forest
                    ecosystem with an intact canopy there is minimal surface runoff. Presently,
                    under the Bracken at the top of the watershed is bare rock. The positive
                    feedback loop between fire and flooding is creating a downward spiral of
                    cascading effects that is a National Security issue.

                    It is proposed to create a series of fire traces, check dams, contour
                    drains and terraces, where applicable, on the exposed areas of the ridge
                    starting from the top, coming down. These earthworks will capture and hold
                    rainwater and cause infiltration to reduce flooding and recharge the water
                    table. In order to facilitate this programme of works, a temporary camp
                    within the forested area close to the ridge will be constructed to
                    accommodate work crews.

                    Constructing permanent structures on a flood plain is a type one error: an
                    inevitable hazard. Port of Spain, being a case in point, has had a long
                    history of this predicament. The St. Ann&#8217;s River, formerly known as,
                    &#8220;el Rio Tragarita&#8221;, (from the Spanish,<em> tragar,</em> to
                    swallow or engulf, literally the little swallower) described as a,
                    &#8220;forty foot chasm&#8221;, regularly washed the earthen and wooden
                    buildings of the city out into the Gulf of Paria. Governor Chacon had its
                    course diverted from the street bearing his name to its present location as
                    the East Dry River in an effort to mitigate this effect, however the
                    problem remains till today.

                    Despite the best efforts of the Fondes Amandes Community Reforestation
                    Project (FACRP) and other National Reforestation and Watershed
                    Rehabilitation Programme (NRWRP) groups in the POS watershed loss of forest
                    canopy continues. These groups, working from the bottom coming up, clearing
                    fire traces and planting trees are challenged to get control of the higher
                    reaches of the ridge. Gaining access to these slopes becomes a day&#8217;s
                    work in and of itself.

                    Fires continue to be lit both carelessly and intentionally along the Lady
                    Chancellor Road and by members of the communities on the eastern slopes of
                    Maraval. The culture of bio-phobia that equates &#8220;bush&#8221; with
                    danger and fire as a cleansing agent are exacerbated as the police fail to
                    charge those committing arson even when presented with the most damning of
                    evidence.

                    As housing development, both planned and un-planned continue to grow higher
                    up the hillsides due to population pressure the incidences of fire and
                    flooding increase. The impermeable surfaces of galvanize, concrete, pitch
                    and lawns or dirt yards on slopes intensify the degree of surface runoff
                    contributing to flood events.

                    soil has been completely lost. Contour drains and terraces will be created
